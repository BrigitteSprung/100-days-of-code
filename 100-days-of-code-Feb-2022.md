### Day 1: May 20, 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I made a Discord Bot!

**Thoughts:** This was a code along tutorial, but it was so exciting to see something work. And it was nice to do something different to Front-end Dev for a change. I learnt more about how api's work and how to keep a server up and running continuously.
